# witd

`witd` is a light executable that makes it easy to use Wit.ai on a wide range of devices. It manages client audio recording and communication wit Wit.ai.

##Â Why?

Wit.ai allows developers to build smart apps and devices. By streaming end-users' voice to Wit's speech-to-action API, it is possible to determine the intent of the end users as well as all the details required to fulfill their requests.

However, developers are often in trouble when it comes to recording the audio and streaming it to Wit.ai API.

We provide clients that do exactly that for iOS and Android.
`witd` is an attempt to do the same for more devices, e.g. Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc.

## How to build

`witd` is written in [Rust][rust]. We recommend you use [Cargo][cargo] to build it:

```bash
$ cargo build
```

## Start the server

Start the server:

```bash
$ HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=9877 ./target/witd
```

## Send requests

### Speech request

For the moment, witd requires that you tell it when to start and stop recording. Moving forward, 2 new modes will be added:

- "silence detection" to stop the recording
- "hands-free" to start and stop the recording when user is speaking

Start recording audio and streaming it to wit.ai:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:9877/start&access_token=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

Stop recording audio and receive the wit.ai response:
```bash
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:9877/stop"
{"_text":"Hello world","msg_id":"fbe2a1ff-3869-49d8-885d-67e23357ffdc","outcomes":[{"_text":"Hello world","confidence":0.263,"entities":{"location":[{"suggested":true,"value":"Hello world"}]},"intent":"get_weather"}]}
```

### Text request

witd can also directly send text requests to wit.ai:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:9877/text?q=Hello%20world&access_token=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
{"_text":"Hello world","msg_id":"fbe2a1ff-3869-49d8-885d-67e23357ffdc","outcomes":[{"_text":"Hello world","confidence":0.263,"entities":{"location":[{"suggested":true,"value":"Hello world"}]},"intent":"get_weather"}]}
```

## Running on Raspberry Pi

The easiest way to have witd running on a Raspberry Pi is to trust us and run the provided ARM binary:

```bash
./witd-arm
```

### Building witd-arm for Raspberry Pi (for the brave)

The procedure below describes how to cross-compile witd-arm on a Debian host targeting Raspbian. It may work with other configurations but has not been tested yet.

*Disclaimer: it is very ugly. The idea is to install the required libraries on the Rasperry Pi, and mount the Raspberry's /lib folders on the Debian host remotely, so that the linker running on the Debian host can access the Pi's libraries. Another approach would be to manually copy the libraries from the Raspberry Pi to the Debian host, but this often ends up in a dependency hell.*

* Setup a Rust cross-compiler by following [these instructions](https://github.com/npryce/rusty-pi/blob/master/doc/compile-the-compiler.asciidoc). However, make sure to pass the extra `--enable-rpath` argument to the configure script:
```bash
./configure --target=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --prefix=$HOME/pi-rust --enable-rpath && make && make install
```
* Install the required libraries on the Raspberry Pi
```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcrypto++-dev libsox
pi@raspberrypi ~$ cp /usr/lib/libsox.so /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libsox.so // sorry for the mess, but we'll need it later
```
* Install sshfs so that the build script running on the host can access the precompiled libraries on the Raspberry Pi by mounting a remote filesystem:
```bash
sudo apt-get install sshfs
sudo modprobe fuse
sudo adduser `whoami` fuse
sudo chown root:fuse /dev/fuse
sudo chmod +x /bin/fusermount
newgrp fuse (or logout/login)
newgrp
```
* Run the build script:
```bash
./raspbuild pi@192.168.1.54
```
where `pi` is a user on the Raspberry Pi and 192.168.1.54 is the IP of the Raspberry Pi. The script will mount the /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf and /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf folders of your Raspberry Pi at the same locations on your Debian host, so you need to:
* have read access to /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf and /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf on the Raspberry Pi (which is the case for the default user on Raspbian)
* be able to sudo on the Debian host
* make sure you don't already have a /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf or /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf on your Debian host

The resulting executable should be in `target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/witd`.
